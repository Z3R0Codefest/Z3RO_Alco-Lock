# Z3RO_Alco-Lock
Our team name is Z3RO. We have chosen the topic Urban Transit Solutions as our primary theme and Eco-Tourism as our secondary theme. Did you know that on an average day, 30% of road accidents worldwide are caused by drunk driving? To solve this our team has developed ‘The Alco-Lock’. ‘The Alco-Lock’ is a mechanism that is used to reduce the number of accidents caused by drunk driving in urban areas. It uses a pollution sensor that acts as a breathalyzer, this works because the pollution sensor considers ethanol to be a pollutant. If alcohol is detected in the driver's breath, then the car will go to a location that was preset by the driver. ‘The Alco-Lock’ uses fuel efficient driving techniques in order make the car eco friendly.
